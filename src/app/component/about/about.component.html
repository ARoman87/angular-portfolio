            Hello, my name is <span class="important">Angel Roman</span> and this is my backstory. After finishing my Bachelor in Criminal Justice in 2012 I decided to further my education and take classes in Information Technology. The more programming classes I took, the more I fell in love with software development. This coincided with the conclusion of my military commitment and I took the next several years to focus on a career in law enforcement and spend time concentrating on my young family. Although I had put my education on hold, I still continued to take courses to further my IT knowledge. Fast forward to 2021, I decided to jump back in and become a <span class="important">Software Engineer.</span> In 2022, I graduated with a <span class="coral">Bachelor in Information Technology</span> with a Concentration in <span class="important">Software Development.</span> In earning this degreeI have learned multiple languages and am ready to find the next challenge in my career where I am able to use these skills.
        </p>
            <br/>
        <p>
            Outside of programming, I have both a military and law enforcement background. I served 5 years in the <span class="coral">United States Marine Corps</span> where I worked on electronic countermeasures for all Marine Corps helicopters. While in this capacity I was responsible for the training and operation of squadrons of up to 1,000 Marines. My 6 years of Law Enforcement helped to solidify my ability to work with multiple departments as well as various federal agencies which has helped to cultivate an understanding of <span class="important">team building, personal growth and gained wisdom.</span> 
        </p>
            <br/>
        <p>
            So why would you want to have <span class="coral">ME</span> on your team? What I do not have in experience, I do have in <span class="important">enthusiasm.</span> Enthusiasm to solve problems, work with a team or just the enthusiasm to take on a solo project and work it until I have a solution. I bring a mindset of <span class="coral">wonder</span>, where I can bring critical skills to remove single points of failure through my tenacity. I'm not afraid to ask questions, because it can result in creative ideas .I don't have a programming background which means I don't have preconceived ideas which allow for new and fresh solutions. <span class="important">I have adapted</span> to change throughout my career and I feel it has helped me to learn quickly and work well in both a team and individual setting. I believe the best teams are made up of individuals with the most diverse backgrounds and experiences and <span class="coral">I hope to become a part of yours.</span>
